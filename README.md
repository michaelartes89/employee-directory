# employee-directory
This application is an online employee directory which allows a user to view all active employees. To remove and employee from the current view, the user can click the red x in the corner of the employee's card. The user can also search for an employee by entering the id# into the input field and clicking the search button. Clearing the Search input field and clicking the reset button will return the view back to the original list of all employees in the directory. 
This project was created for chapter 19 of the JHU Full-Stack Bootcamp.
